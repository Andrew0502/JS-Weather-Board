# weather-board

## Description 

This app is designed to help someone track the weather in various cities. It gets the data from a third party API and dynamically generates a page with the name of the city, the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It also dynamically generates a 5 day forecast beneath the dashboard.
