# weather-board

## Description 

This app is designed to help someone track the weather in various cities. It gets the data from a third party API and dynamically generates a page with the name of the city, the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It also dynamically generates a 5 day forecast beneath the dashboard.


repository is a daily planner app to help with scheduling one's work day. It dynamically shows you what time of the work day it is and lists out what you have written down in that hour. It stores what you write down in local storage and displays it when you re-open the app.
